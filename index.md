### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    All of Lab 2 would have to be a favorite lab of mine because of the lab being the first lab other than the “Hello World” lab where I got to work on my own through applications such as Linux, Visual Studio, and a Terminal. I was able to learn and fix my program's formatting and lint for the first time with the help of the terminals compiler which not only found errors to my program, but also addressed ways to fix that specific error. While Lab 2 may be one of the easier labs done this year, I enjoyed learning and working on fixing the programs formatting and lint because it not only made good practice for the labs to come in the near future, but it also allowed me to program for the first time ever which was something that I was always curious about and never had the chance until this year.
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because of the use of the multiple sub files which made a program that plays an animation. I was able to initialize and include input file streams for the first time and manage to program my first functioning animation. This lab was one of my favorites due to the program not only being the first lab to implement animations, but also the fact that the animation was themed around Halloween due to the lab being assigned near October 31st.
* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because of it being the guessing game from a prior lab with the addition of declarations of classes such as GameState. I was able to initialize classes and functions for the first time in this lab as well as learn that adjustments made to previous work can change the program completely. This lab also took me the longest to complete when compared to other labs which is why I enjoyed it so much because of the fact that I had to struggle for hours but managed to not only make the program work efficiently, but also was able to enjoy playing the Hilo game with family and friends.
